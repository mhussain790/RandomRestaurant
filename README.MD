# Random Restaurant

The Animal Shelter application was designed as a project for CS 261 - Software Engineering following the Software Design process. This app was created with the purpose of aiding undecisive users that are unable to decide on a restaurant to eat or order from.

This application was created using Flask for the back end and utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app also incorporates the Yelp API in order to retrieve restaurant data and categories. A microservice was also developed which generates a Google Maps iFrame from the generated restaurant data to show the map location of the restaurant.
